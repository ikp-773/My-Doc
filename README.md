Over the course of our lifetimes, we visit numerous hospitals and clinics, and some of us receive routine consultations from various doctors at various hospitals for various conditions. A patient's case file from one hospital is not shared with another hospital.

We think it should be able to link various patient case files from various hospitals and put them in a single repository that any doctor can access when treating a patient. When a patient is brought in unconscious or in a coma and family members or other caregivers are unfamiliar with the patient's medical history, this system will be of great assistance.

Our goal is to develop a patient-focused mobile application. Each patient will receive a special identification code, through which the doctors who are currently providing consultation services can access the patient's medical file. The patient receives notification anytime his documents are accessed, making it harder for anyone to acquire the unique code and preserving their privacy. The unique code is only available in QR, making it harder for any individual other than the consulting doctor to obtain it.

## Problems Faced

Challenges we ran into
✅ Backend End Creation: None of us had much idea of backend so we took help from mentor and studied flask. But we still couldn't stucture the whole backend and create all API's.

✅ Data Handling: Data transfer via the backend to the app was difficult.
